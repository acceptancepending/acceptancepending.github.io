This is the project repository for [acceptancepending.github.io](acceptancepending.github.io), the website for the musical *Acceptance Pending.* 

*Acceptance Pending*, written and composed by [Gabriel McDerment](https://www.gabrielmcderment.com/), follows Andrea, a high school senior, as she fights through the daunting US college application process and experiences the mental-health strain that affects so many students.

The cast, a mix of university students from NYU and other NYC- and Florida-area schools, is honored to present an element of the current youth mental health crisis that has impacted them so much. At their Fringe debut, this cast invites you to step into Andrea's world and witness not only their mental health struggle, but the hope they have found together.

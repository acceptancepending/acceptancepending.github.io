                            <h4>Actor - "Andrea"</h4>
                            <p>Laureana Kennedy, from Tallahassee, Florida, is a classically trained actress and college freshman who has 
                                performed in over 25 musical theatre productions; favorites include Ursula in <it>The Little Mermaid,</it> 
                                Spiker in <it>James and the Giant Peach,</it> the Baroness in <it>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,</it> Violet Bick 
                                in <it>It's a Wonderful Life,</it> Genie in <it>Aladdin,</it> Nala in <it>The Lion King,</it> and Grace 
                                Farrell in <it>Annie.</it> Born with a love to lift the world through theatre and song, she also pursues this 
                                desire offstage and in her community and church. She has performed solos and has participated in musical 
                                productions at multiple festivals and Disney World Workshops. Although she is a vibrant and enthusiastic performer, 
                                it surprises most that comedic, villianous roles come quite naturally to her. Laureana has received vocal
                                training in almost all genres of music and would be described as a <it>soubrette</it> or light lyric type with a 
                                soprano range of F3-F5. As she blossomed onstage, her fondness for dance grew, and she went on to receive extensive 
                                traning in all genres of dance; she feels most expressive in lyrical, hip-hop, and traditional musical theatre 
                                dance. She plans to pursue a BFA from BYU in their prestigious Music Dance Theatre program and advance the 
                                light as an actress, singer/songwriter, and teacher.

                            <h4>Actor - "Mom"</h4>
                            <p>Rafaella Mark is a rising junior at NYU Tisch School of the Arts musical theater studio, the New Studio 
                                on Broadway. She has also received training from Stonestreet Studios in film and TV production and acting. 
                                From Santa Fe, New Mexico, she has had the honor of both competing and winning in the 2021 Enchantment 
                                Awards and going on to compete and become a semi-finalist in the 2021 Jimmy Awards for best actress. 
                                Rafaella enjoys playing strong and complex female characters ranging recently from Donna in <it>Mamma 
                                Mia!</it> to Lady Macbeth in <it>Macbeth.</it> Rafaella grew up with a deep love for all genres of 
                                music. She draws musical inspiration from Motown and Jazz and was trained in classical and jazz piano 
                                which greatly influenced her vocal style. She has performed in venues ranging from cabaret at 
                                <it>Don't Tell Mama NYC</it> to piano recitals at Steinway Hall. Outside of theater, Rafaella has 
                                and continues to pursue film and stunt work, songwriting and composition, and street and portrait 
                                photography. She has always believed that art is one of, if not the most, precious facilitators for 
                                change due to its subjective nature, and she strives to bring deep meaning, comedy, and relatability into 
                                all of her performances. She is forever grateful to her teachers, friends, and family that have supported
                                her.

                            <h4>Support Staff</h4>
                            <p>Thomas Atkins, from Huntsville, Alabama, has more than a decade of performing under his belt, though 
                                he is new to the world of musical theater. As a classically trained trombonist, Thomas has performed 
                                with the Auburn University Concert Band, the Auburn University Marching Band, the University of Alabama 
                                in Huntsville Wind Ensemble, and the Huntsville Youth Symphony. By trade, Thomas is an electrical 
                                engineer with his Master's degree in power engineering. Nowadays, Thomas combines his love for music 
                                and his skills in engineering into a passion for audio technology. He has learned from some of the best 
                                audio engineers in Alabama and has led audio/visual programs for over a decade. Thomas plans to continue 
                                sharing his passions with his family and the world through volunteering and eventually, hopefully, 
                                teaching. He currently lives in Alabama with his lovely wife, Hannah Rose.
